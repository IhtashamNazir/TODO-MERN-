# Instructions
Develop a React application and a server with an API to manage a todo list.

At a minimum, the application should have the following capabilities:

* Add item to todo list.
* Remove an item from the todo list.
* Permanence of information in the browser (closed and open the page keeps the todo)

# Technical requirement
The React client should at least have the following components (you can create more if needed):

* A todo with a button to delete (done).
* A list of todo.
* A form for adding todo.


# Evaluation criteria
The work will be evaluated on the level of functionality achieved. A basic level of functionality is requested and several extras are available.

## Base (MVP)
* Addition of todo (client and server)
* Removal of todo (client and server)
* Permanence of todos

## Extra 1 - Connection to a DB
Your server must use an external database of your choice.
The data must be permanent between a restart of the server.

## Extra 2 - Online deployment
Use an external platform (ex: Heroku) to put your application online.

## Extra 3 - Added an additional action for todos
Add an action to complete a todo without deleting it. The completed todo must be able to be displayed, hidden or displayed at the end of the list.

## Extra 4 - Categorization of todo
Add the possibility of having categories for the todos. It should be possible to filter todos by category.
